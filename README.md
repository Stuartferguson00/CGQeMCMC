Code used to in the paper "Quantum-enhanced Markov Chain Monte Carlo for systems larger than your Quantum Computer"

It builds upon the numerics in Layden's work on the Quantum enhanced Markov Chain Monte Carlo (QeMCMC): https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06095-4, with the main contribution focussed on applying a "coarse graining" to the quantum proposal in order to analyse the possibility of some dampened quantum speedup remaining while the number of required qubits is lowered. The code is built upon another repository: https://github.com/pafloxy/quMCMC.
